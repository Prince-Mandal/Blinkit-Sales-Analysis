I conducted a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit's sales data using Power BI to create an interactive dashboard. The project involved:

> Analyzed total sales of $997K across various product categories and outlet types.
> Examined 7,060 unique items to understand product assortment and performance.
> Evaluated the average customer rating of 3.9 to assess overall customer satisfaction.
> I Calculated the average sales per transaction at $141 to gain insight into purchasing patterns.
> The visualization of sales trends from 2012 to 2022 clearly shows significant growth and stabilization.

- I'd broken down the sales by outlet location types (Tier 1, 2, 3) and sizes (Small, Medium, High).
- Categorized products by fat content and analyzed their impact on sales.
- I identified the top-selling item types, which were fruits and snacks, leading to revenue generation.

This project proves my proficiency in data analysis, visualization techniques, and deriving actionable insights from complex datasets using Power BI.
